# Pizza Sales Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis and visualization of pizza sales data using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. The goal of this project is to uncover key insights and trends in pizza sales, such as daily and monthly order trends, sales distribution across pizza categories and sizes, and identifying top/bottom sellers.

The visualizations created provide useful insights for decision-makers, such as sales trends, customer preferences, and the performance of various pizza categories and sizes.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Used to query and extract data from the pizza sales database. Queries were written to clean, transform, and aggregate the data required for visualizations.
- **Power BI**: Used to create interactive dashboards for visualizing various aspects of pizza sales, such as trends, percentages, and performance comparisons.

## Charts and Visualizations

The following charts were created as part of the project:

1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders**:
   - A bar chart that shows the trend of total pizza orders over time. This helps in identifying patterns or fluctuations in daily order volumes.

2. **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**:
   - A line chart that displays the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart helps identify peak hours of order activity.

3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**:
   - A pie chart visualizing the distribution of sales across various pizza categories. This helps in understanding which pizza categories contribute the most to total sales.

4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**:
   - A pie chart showing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This provides insight into customer preferences for pizza sizes.

5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**:
   - A funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each category. This allows for comparison between the sales performance of different categories.

6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**:
   - A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas, based on revenue, total quantity sold, and total orders. This helps in identifying the most popular pizzas.

7. **Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**:
   - A bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 pizzas in terms of revenue, total quantity sold, and total orders. This chart helps in identifying underperforming or less popular pizzas.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The pizza sales data was extracted, cleaned, and transformed using SQL queries. This included handling missing values, transforming data into the correct format, and creating the necessary aggregations.

2. **SQL Queries**:
   - SQL queries were written to retrieve daily orders, sales by category and size, total quantity, revenue data, and more. These queries were used to fetch the data for each chart.

3. **Visualization with Power BI**:
   - Power BI was used to import the cleaned and processed data.
   - Different types of charts (bar, line, pie, and funnel) were created for each requirement.
   - Interactive filters and slicers were added to the dashboard to allow users to explore the data further (e.g., filtering by date or pizza category).

## Usage

1. Open the Power BI file (`Pizza_Sales_Dashboard.pbix`) to view the interactive dashboard.
2. Use the filters and slicers to explore the data for different time periods or pizza categories.
3. View the charts to gain insights into order trends, customer preferences, and pizza performance.

## Key Insights

- **Order Trends**: Daily and hourly trends highlight peak periods for pizza orders.
- **Sales Distribution**: Pizzas in certain categories and sizes are significantly more popular, providing insights for inventory management and marketing.
- **Top and Bottom Sellers**: Understanding which pizzas perform the best and worst allows the business to optimize their menu and sales strategy.

## Future Improvements

- **Real-time Data**: Integrate the Power BI dashboard with live data sources for real-time sales analysis.
- **Additional Metrics**: Add more advanced metrics like profit margins, customer satisfaction scores, or geographical data to enhance the analysis.
